h1. Retina Images

Retina Images serves different images based on the device being used by the viewer.

Once setup on your website (very simple!) all you have to do is create a high-res version of each image you would like optimised for retina screens and all the work is done for you. You don’t even need to change any <code><img></code> tags (providing they have a height or width).to change any <code><img></code> tags.

h2. How it Works

# When the page loads on the viewers device, a cookie holding the <code>devicePixelRatio</code> is set by either JavaScript or CSS (if JS is disabled).
# When an image is requested by the server, the <code>.htaccess</code> file tells <code>retinaimages.php</code> to serve the image instead.
# <code>retinaimages.php</code> then checks for the following conditions:
#* A cookie holding <code>devicePixelRatio</code> exists.
#* The value set in the cookie is greater than 1.
#* A high-res version of the image exists.
# If any of the above are false, it will send the regular image. Otherwise, the high-res image is sent in its place.

h2. Installation & Examples

Visit "http://retina-images.complexcompulsions.com":http://retina-images.complexcompulsions.com for installation instructions and a set of demonstrations.

h2. Benfits

* Only one image is downloaded by the viewer.
* All standard raster images (.jpg, .png, .gif & .bmp) are able to be served as high-res.
* Fallback to regular image if high-res image isn’t available.
* Fallback to regular image if JavaScript and CSS or Cookies are disabled.

h2. Drawbacks

* <code><img></code> tags must have either a width or height attribute specified.
* CSS background images must have a background-size property. See "CSS Images":http://retina-images.complexcompulsions.com#setupcss for details.
